Quotes:

`The apparently rationalistic religions of the East are in essence ancestor cults; therefore they stop short at an early stage of the reconstruction of 
the past.`

` The most essential 
difference apart from the name of their God 
is that the Jewish religion entirely relinquishes 
the worship of the sun, to which the Egyptian one 
still adhered. When comparing the Jewish with 
the Egyptian folk religion we received the 
impression that, besides the contrast in principle, 
there was in the difference between the two 
religions an element of purposive contradiction. 
This impression appears justified when in our 
comparison we replace the Jewish religion by that 
of Aton, which Ikhnaton as we know developed 
in deliberate antagonism to the popular religion. 
We were astonished and rightly so that the 
Jewish religion did not speak of anything beyond 
the grave, for such a doctrine is reconcilable with 
the strictest monotheism. This astonishment 
disappears if we go back from the Jewish religion 
to the Aton religion and surmise that this feature 
was taken over from the latter, since for Ikhnaton 
it was a necessity in fighting the popular religion 
where the death god Osiris played perhaps a 
greater part than any god of the upper regions.`
