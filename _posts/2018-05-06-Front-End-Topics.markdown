I think the topics about front end development, it should include the following topics:

Language: javascript, css, html

Tool: IDE, devtools, browser, remote debug

Interaction: animation, user behavior, elegant, DOM operation

UI: DOM, Image, SVG, Canvas, WebGl, Video, Audio, compatibility

Libraries: Backbone, React, Angular

Ajax: server, status code, nodejs

Development: environment setup, source map, breakpoints, Fiddler, modules dependency

TDD: Jest, mocha, console.assert, chromeheadless

Product: build, bundler

AI: user inference

Domain: B to B, Finance, Game etc

I'll code a project with all the above technologies:

{% highlight typescript %}

{% endhighlight %}



To be continued

Best luck to you!
